EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
```

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Initialize the database (optional):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/init
```

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Install Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

   - Go to your project settings
   - Add the environment variables (DATABASE_URL, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS)

4. Initialize the database after deployment:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/init
```

## File Uploads

The application handles file uploads for:

- Order receipts (PDF)
- Schedule images (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Bank logos (JPG, PNG)
- Model images (JPG, PNG, WebP)

Files are stored in the `uploads/` directory and served via the `/api/uploads/[...path]` endpoint.

## Database Schema

The application expects the following PostgreSQL tables:

- `users` - User accounts
- `contact` - Contact messages
- `commandes` - Orders
- `banks` - Bank information
- `models_images` - Model images

## CORS Configuration

The API is configured to allow requests from any origin (`*`) for development. In production, you should configure specific origins in the middleware.

## Notes

- The application uses PostgreSQL as the database
- File uploads are handled using FormData
- Email functionality uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- All API responses are in JSON format
- Error handling includes appropriate HTTP status codes

## Architecture

This Next.js application is built with the following architecture:

- API routes are located in the `app/api/` directory
- File uploads use FormData for handling multipart data
- Database queries use PostgreSQL syntax
- CORS is handled via middleware
- Static file serving is handled via API routes
